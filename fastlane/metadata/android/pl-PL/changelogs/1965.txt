There’s an exciting new update to our Android app! We’ve smashed some pesky bugs, including the issue with task reordering! You can now view and assign attribute points (or choose auto-allocation)! We’ve added Equipment to the Market, plus the ability to change your login name and email, reset or delete your account, make changes to your profile, and access Fix Character Values. You can also request a password reset from the login screen! We hope this makes your Habitica experience even better!
